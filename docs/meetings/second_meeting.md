# The Second Meeting

The second meeting will pick up where the first left off. The majority of the
meeting will be free-form time for hackers to continue expanding their portfolio
websites. At the end of the meeting, everyone will come up to the front of the
room and demo their website. As in the first meeting, bringing food is a good
idea :wink:.

[Click here][second_meeting_template] for our slideshow template for the second
meeting. Make sure to [customize it](#slideshow-presentations).

Here's our suggested schedule:

1. [Wait for hackers to arrive (5 minutes)][1]
2. [Announcements (5 minutes)][2]
3. [Example demo (5 minutes)][3]
4. [Hacking Time (45 minutes)][4]
5. [Demos (30 minutes)][5]

## Wait for Hackers to Arrive

This'll be very similar to the first meeting. Put on a playlist (not too loud)
and have a slide on the projector to let people know they're in the right
place.

## Announcements

Announcements are your opportunity to share any updates with your members and
let them know what they'll be doing in this meeting. In addition to sharing the
meeting's schedule, they're useful for sharing upcoming events, upcoming guest
visits, and any other information relevant to your members.

Tell your members that for this meeting, they're going to continue where they
left off and continue building their websites. 30 minutes before the end of the
meeting, everyone will come up to the front and demo the websites they've
built. If they don't finish their website before demos, that's okay -- they'll
demo whatever they have.

After announcements, you're going to give an example of what a demo looks like.

## Example Demo

You'll want to give an example of what a demo looks like so your members know
what to expect at the end of the meeting. The best way to do this is to demo a
project that you or another person have built for the Personal Website
workshop.

If you don't have a website that you built to demo, go ahead and pull up one of
the Personal Website workshop examples that were shown in the first meeting and
use it. [Click here][demo] for an example of what a project demo looks like
(this demo was given at a conference).

## Hacking Time

This'll basically be the same as the free-form hacking section in the first
meeting. Members will continue building their websites. Your role is to foster
an environment where people are comfortable asking for help.

Just like in the first meeting, when people do have questions, be eager to help
them out. It's also a good idea to put on an upbeat playlist (but again, not
too loud -- people should feel comfortable talking with one another).

## Demos

Before getting to the demos themselves, give your members 30, 15 minute, and 5
minute warnings so they aren't caught off guard.

30 minutes before demos start, have everyone email you a link to their website.
After making this announcement, go to each person individually to confirm that
they emailed you a link. If they run into any trouble, help them now. Hackers
will be able to continue to add to their websites after they email you the link
-- any changes they make will be live at the same URL they emailed you after
they push to GitHub. Tell everyone not to worry if they don't finish, and that
it's fine to demo whatever they have.

**Quick warning before we get into the nitty-gritty of running demos: these are
hard to facilitate and you're going to have to be detail-oriented when running
them.**

To run the demos themselves, pick a hacker to demo first and a direction to
form "the line" for demoing in (e.g., clockwise around the room). Have the
first person come up and pull up their website from your email. Have the person
who'll demo second also come up and be ready to start their demo as soon as the
first person finishes. While the second person is pulling up their demo, have
the third person come up and be ready to start their demo as soon as the second
person finishes. Continue this until everyone has demoed.

After each person demos, celebrate. Clap and cheer for them. Have fun and get
members doing this with you -- you want the person demoing to feel accomplished
after they finish.

Demos easily get backlogged, so it's important to keep them moving fast. Each
demo should be a minute long -- make an announcement that everyone will need to
keep their demos under a minute.
