## Waiting For Hackers

Put music on and have the first slide on the projector to let people know
they're in the right place.

## Hacking on Projects

This'll be the same as the free-form hacking section in the second meeting.
Members will continue building on what they started during the previous
meeting. Your role will be to create an environment where people are
comfortable asking for help.

## Running Demos

You'll want to do the same thing you did in the second meeting to run demos.

## Reminder for Next Meeting

- Five minutes before the meeting is over, make sure to hit the last slide in
  the presentation and tell everyone the time and place for the next meeting.
- Let everyone know theyâ€™ll be doing a new workshop next time, and give a
  brief and enticing description.
- Thank them for coming!
