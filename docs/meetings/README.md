# Meeting Templates

As previously mentioned, Hack Club meetings alternate between running workshops
and free-form hacking (with demos). From here on out, we'll refer to meetings
with workshops as _workshop days_ and meetings with free-form hacking and demos
as _hack days_.

## Slideshow Presentations

In addition to the templates for the [first][first_meeting_template] and
[second][second_meeting_template] meetings, we've also created two more
templates to help you prepare. We'll refer to these throughout the sections
below. One of the presentations is a standard [Workshop Day
Template][workshop_day_template], and the other is a standard [Hack Day
Template][hack_day_template]. To use the presentations:

1. Make a copy of the presentation to customize it for your club (to do this,
   go to `File > Make a copy...`).
2. In the first two slides, update the recap (if applicable) and the schedule
   for what you'll be doing.
3. Customize the remainder of the slides according to the type of meeting:
   - For Workshop Day:
     - Choose the workshop you'll want to run for this meeting and put its name
       in the appropriate slide.
     - Add the images corresponding to this workshop. A good tip is to add one
       or two standard examples of what the workshop will produce, and then one
       or two examples of what it would look like to expand on the
       workshop, as inspiration.
     - Include a link at the end of the workshop to
       `workshops.hackclub.com/[WORKSHOP]`.
   - For Hack Day:
     - Add the images corresponding to the workshop started in the previous
       Workshop Day, perhaps one standard example and a few examples that take
       it further.
     - Choose a workshop for the following week and add a sneak preview to the
       end of the slideshow.
4. Double check: make sure you have replaced any text in brackets, like
   `[HIGH_SCHOOL]`, with the proper information for your club, as well as any
   sample images, with actual images.
5. Share your customized presentation with your leadership team and get
   feedback.
6. Publish to your club's website.
