## Hacker Arrival

Put on a playlist and have the first slide on the projector to let people know
they're in the right place.

## Workshop

This'll be just like how you ran the first website workshop, except for the
current workshop you're on. [Click here][first_workshop] for a link to the first workshop guidelines. Of course, adapt the approach based on what works best for your club and the specific workshop you're running.

## Hacking

After hackers finish the workshop, they're going to transition into free-form
hacking to continue building upon what they have from the workshop. During this
time, the most important thing for you to do is create an environment where
people are comfortable asking for help.

When people do have questions, be eager to help them out. You want to set the
example that asking for help is a good thing. It's also a good idea to turn the
music back on (not too loud, people should feel comfortable talking).

## Next Meeting Reminder

Five minutes before the meeting is over, get everyone's attention to remind
them about the next meeting. Say when and where it'll be and that everyone will
be finishing up what they worked on today and demoing at the end of the
meeting.

And thank them for coming!
