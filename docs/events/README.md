# Running an Event

Welcome, (future) event organizers! Hack Club is not only an active community of student makers and leaders, but also a large network of students who organize and support programs where they can share their passion with other students. You are going to do great thingsâ€”**you can change students' lives!**

This section of the leadership guide is partially adapted from the **[CodeDay] Organizer Guide**. You can find the original guides here: [Organizer Guide], [Day-Of Guide]. We appreicate all the staff and community members of [Srnd.org] who contributed to the original guides.

We have forked the CodeDay organizing guides and modified them, so that they can help student leaders like you run not only successful CodeDays, but other fantastic events, including hackathons, hack camps, or other events associated with certain organizations.

We also adapted material from the **Major League Hacking [Hackathon Organizer Guide]**, which is written by contributors of the awesome MLH community, and open-sourced under [the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0)][CC-BY] license. [MLH] is the official student hackathon league, supporting over 200 events every year, with a majority of them being **collegiate hackathons**.

We have modified their guide as well, as there are major differences between a collegiate hackathon and a high school hackathon. We truly believe the power of high school students, and with this guide, you will be able to get yourself started with your own high school hackathon in no time!
