# Running an Event

Welcome, (future) event organizers! Hack Club is not only an active community of student makers and leaders, but also a large network of students who organize and support programs where they can share their passion with other students. You are going to do great thingsâ€”**you can change students' lives!**

This section of the leadership guide is partially adapted from the [CodeDay] Organizer Guide. You can find the original guides here: [Organizer Guide], [Day-Of Guide]. We appreicate all the staff and community members of [Srnd.org] who contributed to the original guides.

[Day-of Guide]: https://www.notion.so/srnd/Event-Guide

We have forked the CodeDay organizing guides and modified them, so that they can help student leaders like you run not only successful CodeDays, but other  fantastic events, including hackathons, hack camps, or other events associated with certain organizations. 

Let's jump into it!
