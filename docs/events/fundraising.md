We recommend you watch the [Meginar], made by the same people behind [Hack Chicago 2018][hc18]. The Meginar is very long, but contains great advice. 

Karthik, a previous Clubs Team member, made an AWESOME guide that explains literally everything about getting sponsorships. Check it out [here][karthikguide]. It's a great guide, with tons of info.
