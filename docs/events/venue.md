# Venue Hunting

In most ways, finding a venue isn't dramatically different from finding other sponsors:

* Finding both venues and sponsors will require contacting local businesses.
* Venue sponsors are still making a donation, only of time instead of money.
* An initial pitch, a phone meeting, and an approvals process are usually required to close both.
* You should be talking to multiple potential venues, just like you should be talking to multiple potential sponsors.
* Potential venue sponsors who can't commit can still be a regular sponsor.

In this section, we'll cover many of the steps involved in finding a venue, but you'll have more luck if you read the sponsorships section as well.

## Where to Look

When considering ideas for a venue, it's a good idea to go through the process of putting together a list of potential sponsors discussed in the Sponsorships section (or review your list, if you've already created one).

### Co-Working Spaces

Our most common venues are co-working spaces for some very good reasons: they're usually small organizations who are willing to take risks, have an interest in building up the tech community, and have a lot of available desks and chairs for student use.

Most cities have at least one co-working space, and you'd do well to put it at the top of your "to-call" list!

### Startup Offices

After co-working spaces, startups are the second-most-common venues for similar reasons: less risk averse and interested in building the community. Unlike co-working spaces, newer startups don't have enough room to host a CodeDay, so you can expect a lower success rate when reaching out. (Interested companies without enough space can often be convinced to sponsor a meal, however!)

Finding startups is also more difficult than finding co-working spaces, since most startups don't try to rank for "Des Moines Startup" on Google. One great way to find startups with enough room is to check meetup.com for technology meetups in your city, then look for the companies who have provided venues.

Searching on Google is still a good avenue (you may come across press mentions), but you may have more luck on crunchbase.com and angel.co.

### Corporate Offices

If you have a big company with a technology focus in your area, they can be a great potential venue and are certainly worth pursuing, but you should be aware that they'll likely move slowly, and are more likely to say "no" for liability reasons after several weeks of discussion. If you're planning to go this route, make sure you're talking to plenty of alternates, even if things seem promising.

Corporate offices are also more likely to be locked into contracts with caterers, security, and A\/V vendors, so you'll need to confirm whether any third-party fees will be required to use the venue and, if so, if the company can sponsor the cost. See the "Considerations" section for more details.

### Libraries and Other Government Buildings

Libraries and Government buildings also make great hosts, but usually have the same problems as corporations.

### Schools

Stay away!

Schools are not only dramatically more risk-averse than corporations and government buildings, but also have a tendency to add restrictions close to the event. More than half of the schools who've told an organizer "yes" have, a month later, added restrictions such as "it can't be overnight", "no minors", or "only students at this school can attend".

This includes both public high schools and universities, although private schools are less prone to these problems and may be worth pursuing.

## Considerations

### Cost

Venue sponsorship should be just that: sponsorship. That means the venue should almost always be free. It's occasionally ok to pay for a venue, but that's usually limited to covering a cleaning or heating cost of less than $300. If you're expecting to spend money on a venue, you should be confident you can offset it with additional sponsorships.

Be aware that many "free" venues have contracts requiring use of specific companies, like hiring their A\/V contractor if you're going to use a projector, or ordering food only from their specific caterer. The cost for these locked-in contracts is usually way out of the event budget \(Microsoft's contracted caterer charges $14 per person just for breakfast cereal\). This is usually only an issue in larger buildings, but it's worth asking about and, if there are any requirements, asking if the company will cover the cost as part of the sponsorship.

### Size and Layout

Your specific space requirements will depend on your expected attendance. For new, smaller cities, a venue might need to hold 60 people, while a large, established city like Phoenix will require space for 300-400! Remember, as well, that you'll need to have a space to hold all these people \(standing, if necessary\) for the kickoff and awards.

For larger events \(above 120\), it's best to have multiple rooms into which you can subdivide the event. Having more than 120 people in one room makes it much less likely that participants will meet people from other teams: it's simply too big.

The layout of the rooms is also important. Venues with a few big rooms are preferred to those with lots of conference rooms. The goal of CodeDay isn't just to make something cool, it's also to encourage a community, and it's hard to build a community when people lock themselves in a small room. \(If the venue does have lots of conference rooms, can you close them off for the event and still have space in the main rooms?

### Location

The location of the venue is important, but we don't mean look for "a good neighborhood." A primary goal of CodeDay is getting students from non-typical backgrounds interested in code, and many of these students don't live in the urban core.

Good access to public transportation, plenty of on-street parking, and name recognition are all things you should look for in a venue.

### Hours and Age

The venue needs to be available for 24-hours, which might mean the venue needs to find staffing for the full weekend.

It also needs to allow students who are under 18 to attend. This is often a major sticking point for really large organiations (particularly universities), so it's worth double-checking -- we've had problems in the past.

### Tables, Chairs, Whiteboards, Outlets, and Wifi

This might go without saying, but the venue should support the expected attendance with tables, chairs, wifi, and distributed access to power.

Organizers occasionally select a venue which can't support the full attendance; in this case you can rent tables and chairs from a party rental company, and borrow power strips and extension cords. This isn't cheap (usually $300-600 to add seating for 100 people), so it's usually a last resort.

## Contacting

Like we'll see in the next Sponsorships section, the best practice with contacting a venue is to start with a **brief** email, see if they're interested in learning more, and try to get them on a phone call to discuss more. Even if you keep it all to email, keeping your initial message brief will help you avoid scaring people off by overwhelming them with details when they're not sold on the concept.

Here's a great sample initial email:

> Hi \[name\],
> 
> I'm helping put together a coding event for high school students in \[city\] on \[date\], \[event name\](\[link\]). It's a 24-hour non-profit event to inspire students to get interested in coding.
> 
> I know \[company name\] has an office locally, and I wondered if hosting the event would be a possibility? Do you have any time in the next week to talk about what's involved, and whether that's possible?

Getting a venue is very similar to getting a cash sponsor: you're asking a company to trade a resoure they have \(a space, and possibly employees to oversee it\) for some benefits \(helping the community, etc\). Accordingly, you can read a lot more on what makes a successful email in the Sponsorships section.
