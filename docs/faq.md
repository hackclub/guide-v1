## What if I can't call my club "Hack Club"?

Teachers/club sponsors/school administrators will sometimes try to ban a club from calling itself "Hack Club" because it includes the word "hack". To fix this, try explaining what "hack" means:

> The word ["hacker"](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hacker) has two meanings, the one we refer to is: a person who is skilled with computers or using tools in new ways.
>
> When we say "hack", we're referring to solving problems cleverly with code â€“ just like "life hacking", except with computers.
>
> When we call ourselves "Hack Club", it means we're building apps, websites, games, and anything else you can imagine.

If that still doesn't work, just reach out to us on [Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/GAE0FFNFN/). A bunch of club leaders have had to deal with this and we're happy to help out.

## What if a member of my club does something inappropriate?

You should warn and ask them stop. You'll want to make sure to tell them what is inappropriate about their actions, as they themselves may not realize that they are doing something inappropriate.

If this persists past the warning, then talk to your teacher/club sponsor/school administrator about the proper course of action to take.

## What if our adviser does not want to let us meet every week?

Sometimes, an advisor might not have the time in their schedule to meet weekly. Ask if you can get a second advisor to meet on the weeks that your current one can't.

Try explaining to advisors why it's important to meet once per week. For example:

> We want our club members to be interested and engaged during meetings so club members have the right expectation for club meetings. It's important to meet at least once per week so club members stay interested in their projects. If we can't meet each week, people might get distracted in the off-time.

Alternatively, you could find a public space to meet in and have your club meeting there.

## What if people come and do non club related activities?

Hack Clubs should be a fun, chill, and creative spaces, where the focus is to create an environment where people want to learn to hack. However, it's not cool when people come with the intention of doing non club related activities, such as playing games or messing around for the fun of it.

If this happens, make them aware of their actions, as they themselves might not know what they are doing is wrong.

If this persists past the warning, then talk to your teacher/club sponsor about the proper course of action to take.
