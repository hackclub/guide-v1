## What if I can't call my club "Hack Club"?

Teachers/club sponsors/school administrators will sometimes try to ban a club from calling itself "Hack Club" because it includes the word "hack". To fix this, try explaining what "hack" means:

> The word ["hacker"](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hacker) has two meanings, the one we refer to is: a person who is skilled with computers or using tools in new ways.
>
> When we say "hack", we're referring to solving problems cleverly with code – just like "life hacking", except with computers.
>
> When we call ourselves "Hack Club", it means we're building apps, websites, games, and anything else you can imagine.

If that still doesn't work, just reach out to us on [Slack](https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C02PA5G01ND). A bunch of club leaders have had to deal with this and we're happy to help out.

## What if a member of my club does something inappropriate?

Have a direct conversation with them about it. Explain what's inappropriate about their actions, since they might genuinely not realize there's an issue.

If the behavior continues, talk to your teacher/club sponsor/school administrator about next steps.

Refer to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/CONDUCT.md) for more information.

## What if our advisor does not want to let us meet every week?

Sometimes, an advisor might not have the time in their schedule to meet weekly. Ask if you can get a second advisor to meet on the weeks that your current one can't.

Try explaining to advisors why it's important to meet once per week. For example:

> We want our club members to be interested and engaged during meetings so club members have the right expectation for club meetings. It's important to meet at least once per week so club members stay interested in their projects. If we can't meet each week, people might get distracted in the off-time.

Alternatively, you could find a public space to meet in and have your club meeting there.

## What if people come and do non-club related activities?

This happens sometimes. People show up to hang out, play games, or just mess around instead of actually working on projects.

The best approach is to have a quick, direct conversation. Something like "Hey, I'm glad you're here, but this time is specifically for coding projects. If you want to just hang out, maybe catch up after the meeting?" Keep it friendly but clear about what the club time is for.

If it keeps happening and starts affecting the club's vibe, loop in your advisor. They can help figure out the best way to handle it for your specific situation.
