# Planning Your Hack Club

Hack Clubs are after-school sessions where people come together to **hack**â€”solve problems creatively.

Hack Club meetings are structured in pairs, so that new projects can be started and demoed each week. The first of the two meetings includes an hour-long workshop to help get members started, and the second is a session of free-form hacking. This emphasis on building things echoes the spirit of hackathons, making Hack Club feel like a continuous hackathon.

Throughout the year, Hack Clubs go to (and sometimes host) hackathons, work on large group projects, and, most importantly, develop into a thriving community of hackers at their high schools.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up your Hack Club and running your first few meetings. After hosting the first two meetings, you will get the hang of how to host subsequent meetings.
