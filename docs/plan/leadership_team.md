# Building Your Leadership Team

We recommend having 2-3 people running the club. When choosing your team, consider close friends who you think have strong leadership skills. In fact, leadership skills are far more important than technical abilities. Great clubs have been started by leaders that have never coded before.

It's also a good idea to have a mix of genders on the team, we've noticed that club member demographics tend to reflect those of the leaders (i.e., if the leadership is all-male, the club will be almost all-male).

When putting together your leadership team, aim for complementary skill sets. The best teams usually have at least one technical leader who can help with code problems and workshops, and one "charming" 😉 leader who excels at outreach, communication, and building community. You don't need a rigid hierarchy. Instead, let each leader own their strengths and collaborate on major decisions.

The key is making sure everyone on the team is genuinely invested. It's fine to divide responsibilities based on who's most passionate about what, but avoid a purely democratic process where less-active leaders can veto decisions. The clubs that work best have leaders who trust each other and make decisions together based on who's putting in the work.
