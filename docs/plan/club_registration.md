# Club Registration

Most high schools require you to register your club with the student council or school administration before having your first meeting.

Generally they have an application to fill out ([click here for an example](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTiXm_NsJswpu1bFEZ5qPaE7xWTBR0uy19y1d0ha_7lOi_DQ/viewform)). Some schools require having a club constitution that outlines the club's purpose and operational procedures. We've created a template constitution for you, which you can find here.

This shouldn't take very long, especially once you have a teacher sponsor backing you.
