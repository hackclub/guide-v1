# Student Sign-ups

Now for the most important part of this whole process: actually getting people to come to your club.

There are generally two primary channels for driving sign-ups:

- Club fair
- Posters

We'll go into depth on both of these in the sections below.

Your sign-up goal should be driven by the number of people you want to attend your meetingsâ€”aim for double that number. If you want to have 20 to 30 members come to your first meeting, you should shoot for at least 50 sign-ups. If you want 30-40 to come, shoot for at least 70.

When it comes to pitching Hack Club, keep it short and simple, like the following:

> Hack Club is a place where people come together to build things with code (like apps, websites, and games).
>
> - By the end of the first meeting, everyone has built their first website and put it online.
> - By the end of the third meeting, everyone has built a website that can call and text your phone.
> - By the fifth meeting, everyone has built their first game and has put it online.
>
> Hack Club is like a continuous hackathon that happens twice a week at school.

Now to go into depth on the three channels for driving sign-ups.

## Club Fair

Most schools have a day for advertising clubs at the beginning of each semester. This commonly called the "club fair", "club day", "club rush", or "club showcase". It is extremely important that you have a presence at this event -- this is your opportunity to get the most important members (freshmen and sophomores) to your first club meeting.

The best way to take advantage of your school's "club day" (or equivalent) is to bring food and be extremely proactive about getting people to give you their names, emails, and phone numbers. Excel or Google Sheets is a good way to collect this info, though it's a good idea to also bring a pencil and a clipboard in case of technical difficulties.

## Posters

Having posters for your club in the hallways and in classrooms exposes new members to your club and reminds people where and when the club meets.
