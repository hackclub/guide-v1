# Student Sign-ups

Now for the most important part of this whole process: actually getting people to come to your club.

There are generally two primary channels for driving sign-ups:

- Club fair
- Posters

We'll go into depth on both of these in the sections below.

Your sign-up goal should be driven by the number of people you want to attend your meetings—aim for double that number. If you want to have 20 to 30 members come to your first meeting, you should shoot for at least 50 sign-ups. If you want 30-40 to come, shoot for at least 70. Basically, you should expect 50% of your sign ups to actually show up.

When it comes to pitching Hack Club, keep it short and simple, like the following:

> Hack Club is where teenagers build real projects with code (apps, websites, games, hardware, whatever you can imagine).
>
> - You get free pizza money for every project you complete ($5 per project, up to $20 per meeting)
> - Free access to pro tools like Zoom Pro, Figma Pro, and 100+ coding workshops
> - Free stickers, posters, and even $100 grants to design your own circuit boards
> - Join 100,000+ other teen makers in our Slack community
> - Access to hackathons and events around the world
>
> Think of it like a continuous hackathon that meets twice a week. You build, you "ship", you get free stuff. Simple as that.

Now to go into depth on the three channels for driving sign-ups.

## Club Fair

Most schools have a day for advertising clubs at the beginning of each semester. This commonly called the "club fair", "club day", "club rush", or "club showcase". It is extremely important that you have a presence at this event -- this is your opportunity to get the most members to your first club meeting.

The best way to take advantage of your school's "club day" (or equivalent) is to bring food and be extremely proactive about getting people to give you their names, emails, and phone numbers. You can use Google Sheets or Excel for example, and if you want to collect that data quicker, use something like Fillout, which has an extremely generous Free plan, looks great, has great integrations and we, at Hack Club, use it everyday, from YSWS submissions to the feedback form for this guide!

## Posters

Having posters for your club in the hallways and in classrooms exposes new members to your club and reminds people where and when the club meets.

Check out the [Hack Club Toolbox](https://toolbox.hackclub.com/) for some awesome posters that we ship to your house, for free! Some older posters are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/tree/master/clubs/posters).
