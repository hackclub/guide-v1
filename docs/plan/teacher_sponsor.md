# Teacher Sponsor and Space

A good teacher sponsor is key to having access to regular space for club meetings and a good relationship with your school. Your sponsor is the person who will get you a classroom for after-school meetings. If things go wrong with the school administration, your sponsor will be your advocate. Choosing the wrong sponsor can be fatal to clubs, so give it careful thought.

The best sponsors are personally invested in spreading coding to students. This is generally the teacher most likely to start a computer science class (or, if you already have one, the current computer science teacher). If you're new to your school and not very familiar with the teachers, a good place to start looking is the math and science department. If your school has a computer lab, start with the teachers that teach classes in it (or if your school has classrooms with computers in it, start with the teachers with computer classrooms). If none of these are available to you, choose a teacher you already like.

Once you've decided on a few potential teacher sponsors, reach out to them and tell them about your idea to start a Hack Club. The best way to do this is to come to their classroom right after school ends (or during lunch) and talk to them in person. If you don't already know the teacher, introduce yourself, tell them that you're looking for a teacher sponsor for this thing called a Hack Club that you're starting, and explain the club to them. Here's an example of what you might want to say:

> Hi Ms. Byrd,

> I'm Zach. I'm currently a freshman and I'm planning to start a Hack Club at the school. It is essentially a computer coding club where students meet regularly to build things like apps, websites, and games together. I've put together a leadership team and I'm currently looking for a teacher sponsor for the club. I figured I'd reach out because I heard you ran the Hour of Code in your classroom in December.

You'll want to get your teacher sponsor to commit to providing a space twice a week after-school for at least an hour and a half (ideally two hours, so there's extra time for members to stay after meetings).

The difficulty of getting a teacher sponsor varies widely school to school. At some schools you'll find a good teacher sponsor on your first try and at others it'll take talking to 5-6 teachers. The most important thing is to be persistent.
