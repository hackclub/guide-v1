It is very important that you can access these sites as you will be using them for the entire period of your club. If any of the sites are blocked by your school, please let a Clubs team member know on the [#leaders](https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C02PA5G01ND) Slack channel, we can help you out!
