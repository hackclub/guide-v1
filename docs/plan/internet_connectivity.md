# Internet Connectivity

Before starting your first meeting, be sure to make sure that the following websites are not blocked by your school firewall!

- https://hackclub.com
- https://workshops.hackclub.com
- https://hackclub.slack.com
- https://github.com
- https://repl.it

It is super important that you can access these sites as you will be using them for the entire school year. If any of the sites are blocked by your school, please let a staff member know on the [#hq](https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/C0C78SG9L/) Slack channel.

## Alternative Access

If you cannot access Hack Club's websites within your school, shhh—we might have a solution.

Instead of accessing our websites from **hackclub.com**, try spelling it backwards—**bulckcah.com**. This is a encrypted reverse of our website, and you should have a better chance of success by using this URL!
