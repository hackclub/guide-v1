# Hack Club Leadership Guide

Welcome, leader! Thanks for starting a Hack Club, and we're super excited to have you here!

## How to use this guide

Starting a Hack Club is easy, but running a great club requires some thinking. Over the past years, Hack Club has worked with hundreds of club leaders and event organizers like you, helping them organize hundreds of club meetings and community events every year. This guide is a product of years of experience from the Hack Club leadership community, as well as tens of thousands of hours of work from our staff members. We sincerely hope that this guide will make your leadership experience easy, and that your club members can have an amazing time attending your meetings and events.

The guide is organized in sections, with each section containing information you need to go through a specific stage of running your club. We have also embedded examples of communication, presentation, or outlines that you may find helpful when planning your club meetings. If you are looking for something specific, you can also search the entire knowledge base.

You should bookmark this guide! As your club grows, you'll find yourself in moments where you need to refer back to this guide. If you have co-leaders running a club with you, you should share this resource with them.
